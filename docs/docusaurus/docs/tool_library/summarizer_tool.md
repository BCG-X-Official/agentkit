# Summarizer tool

## How it works
The summarizer tool can be used to summarize large inputs of text, for example retrieved PDF chunks from the pdf_tool. Different summarization approaches can be used, see the [LangChain documentation](https://python.langchain.com/docs/use_cases/summarization) for various examples of summarization chains.

Different approaches can be used based on the `max_token_length` of the input, which can be configured in `agent.yml`.
