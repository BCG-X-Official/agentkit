# Tool library

A library of commonly used tool archetypes is provided in `backend/app/app/services/chat_agent/tools/library`. These tools can be used out of the box by simply adding the tool to `agent.yml` and `tools.yml` and updating the prompts. You may want to update the tool code to customize for your use case.

For example implementations of the library tools, have a look at the Chinook demo or the public demo on the `demo/public` branch.
