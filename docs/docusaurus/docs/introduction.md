# Introduction
AgentKit is a LangChain / FastAPI / Next.js14 toolkit developed by BCG X to build Agents. Developers can use AgentKit to rapidly build high quality Agent applications that can scale into production-grade apps.

Key advantages of AgentKit include:
- üöÄ **Quickly build high quality Agent apps**: Modular, easy to configure tech stack and a library of useful GenAI tools allows developers to build a strong Agent app in hours
- üíª **Flexible, reactive UI/UX designed for Agents**: React/Nextjs chat-based UI that is easy to configure, with features such as streaming, rendering of tables/visualizations/code, status of Agent actions and more
- üõ°Ô∏è **Focus on reliability**: Easy to configure routing architecture gives control of possible paths Agent can take, increasing reliability and making it suited for real-life use cases

As an example, try the AgentKit codebase helper [demo](https://agentkit.infra.x.bcg.com/)

## Chinook music database demo
For a quick start to test some of the functionality, you can use the dummy Chinook example:
- Ensure you are on the `develop` branch
- Follow the [installation instructions](docs/setup/setup.md) and swap `docker-compose.yml` with `docker-compose-demo.yml` to run the app
- Try the prompt "How many artists and songs are there in the database?" to see AgentKit in action!
