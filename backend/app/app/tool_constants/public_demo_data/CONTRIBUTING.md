# Contributing to AgentX

We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:
- Reporting a bug and ideally submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Adding a tool to the library

## Guidelines
We use Github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

We actively welcome your pull requests:
1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `develop`.
2. If you've changed key features (tools, APIs etc), update the documentation.
3. Ensure the code is clean: passes the set of tests, lints etc.
5. Issue a pull request to the main repo

## Report bugs and add feature requests using Github issues
Please not that *currently* there is no central team working on this repository that is actively resolving bugs and responding to feature requests.

### Bugs:
Provide
1) Summary of the issue
2) Steps to reproduce
3) What you expected vs what actually happened
4) Any notes on why you think this might be happening or things you tried that didn't work


### Features:
Provide a description of the feature you would like. You're encouraged to build it yourself and open a PR :-)
